When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
	When working on a project you want to share or colaborate with others on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because you might not be ready to share your changes.
